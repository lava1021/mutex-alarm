# mutex-alarm
a c-code to demostrate multiple thread cannot access a shared data area at the same time by using alarms
Since for a mutex, it is like a key, one thread is manipulating data while others cannot only if they get the mutex. This project is aiming to show a procedure like this, by using a linked-list to store all the avaliable alarms.
